# tech-assessment
Used for the technical assessment of candidates

## Description
I want you to build a set of end to end test on a specific endpoint.  The goal of that assement is not about the feature but about how you think and how do you organize your code.

## Pre-Requisite
- Access to your AWS Workspace
- Access to the API code
- You can run the app locally so you can explore the feature to build test against


## Assessment
- Create an independant end-to-end test file
- Use the framework "pytest"
- Create the tests for the endpoint POST /assets/properties/me
- The doc is available here : https://api-dev.onewallet.io/documentation/#/properties/assets_properties_me_create


## Deliverables
- Create a tech-assessment.py directly into the onewallet-api folder
- Add comments at the begining of the file that explain how to run the test


## Timing
- This should be done in ~2h, no need to spend the whole day here.
